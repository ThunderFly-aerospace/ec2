===========================

[mjs: updated for git and Mac OS X building]

## Ubuntu dependencies

  sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev


If you got the source from Git:
-------------------------------

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../src
make
make install

The make install step is not necessary for development as all
executabless can be run from with the source tree where that were
created.

General building notes:
-----------------------

Known dependencies (Linux):
	GNU readline-dev	libreadline5-dev
	BOOST C++ Library	libboost-regx-dev
	python2.x
	libusb
  cmake

On Mac OS X, only BOOST and libusb are required; install them with
Homebrew or MacPorts.  In the latter case, it is necessary to add

   CFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib

options to configure in order for it to locate the required headers
and libraries.
